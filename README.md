Gitvis
=========

Visual analysis of group Github accounts.

The main purpose of gitvis is to allow me to explore d3 indepth, and try to take full advantage of it's capabilities.

Personal enrichment is the goal, though I hope people have fun mapping out their friends or company's Githubs and enjoy the beauty of data.

    There are two main branches of this repo.
    The main branch uses PostgreSQL, and is configured with ActiveRecord in the usual manner.

    The "neo4j" branch uses the Neo4j graph database, and the neo4j.rb Active Model wrapper.

    The main branch is what is in active development, while the neo4j branch is more of a personal experiment.
    If I ever feel that the neo4j branch becomes better than the main, it will be merged in.
