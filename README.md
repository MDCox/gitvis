Gitvis
=========

Visual analysis of group Github accounts.

The main purpose of gitvis is to allow me to explore d3 indepth, and try to take full advantage of it's capabilities.

Personal enrichment is the goal, though I hope people have fun mapping out their friends or company's Githubs and enjoy the beauty of data.

Tech
-----------
Gitvis is proudly coded in Ruby, and is made possible by several open source projects.

* [Foundation] - a great CSS framework
* [D3] - JS library for data visualization
* [Rails] - a popular Ruby web framework
* [jQuery] - JS library that makes my life easy
